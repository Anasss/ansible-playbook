Requirements
------------

Target server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Supported platforms
```````````````````

At the moment, we're only supporting Debian/Ubuntu environments for the target server. This is simply because the expertise of the initial authors is with the .deb world. Adding RPM environments should not be difficult, but we need help. Your pull requests are welcome.

At the moment, we are testing with Ubuntu 12 (Precise) LTS and 14 (Trusty) LTS and with Debian Squeeze and wheezy.

SSH access; sudo
````````````````

Beyond the basic platform, the only requirements are that you have ``ssh`` access to the remote server with full ``sudo`` rights.

For local testing via virtual machine, any machine that support VirtualBox/Vagrant should be adequate.

Local setup
^^^^^^^^^^^

Python 2.#, virtualenv, git

Optional
^^^^^^^^

github account for easy branching and customizaiton

Installing Ansible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    virtualenv
